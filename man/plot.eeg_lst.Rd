\title{Create a basic signal plot}
\usage{
\method{plot}{eeg_lst}(x, max_sample = 6400, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{eeg_lst} object.}

\item{max_sample}{Downsample to approximately 6400 samples by default.}

\item{...}{Not in use.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object
}
\description{
\code{plot} creates a ggplot object in which the EEG signal over the whole
recording is plotted by electrode. Useful as a quick visual check for major
noise issues in the recording.
}
\details{
Note that for normal-size datasets, the plot may take some time to compile.
If necessary, \code{plot} will first downsample the \code{eeg_lst} object so that there is a
maximum of 6,400 samples. The \code{eeg_lst} object is then converted to a long-format
tibble via \code{as_tibble}. In this tibble, the \code{.key} variable is the
channel/component name and \code{.value} its respective amplitude. The sample
number (\code{.sample} in the \code{eeg_lst} object) is automatically converted to seconds
to create the variable \code{time}. By default, time is then plotted on the
x-axis and amplitude on the y-axis, and uses \code{scales = "free"}; see \code{\link[ggplot2:facet_grid]{ggplot2::facet_grid()}}.

To add additional components to the plot such as titles and annotations, simply
use the \code{+} symbol and add layers exactly as you would for \code{ggplot::ggplot}.

# Basic plot
plot(data_faces_ERPs)

# Add ggplot layers
plot(data_faces_ERPs) + 
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-500,500))
